## About ##

C & C++ header files for cross-everything support.

These headers define preprocessor macros to test support for different language standards, kernels, operating systems,
compilers, libraries, etc.

A lot of information was taken from the [Pre-defined Compiler Macros wiki] and these headers are basically a (partial)
implementation of that wiki.
